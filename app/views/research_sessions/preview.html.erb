      Don’t worry! If you do not want <%= 'the child in your care' if @research_session.unable_to_consent? %>

    <p>Yes. The goal of design research isnʼt to collect data, itʼs to find the
      insights we need to improve our services. We do not hand over the recordings; we
      edit and share insights relevant to the project. Whenever we share these
      insights, the material is fully anonymised and contributions cannot be
      attributed to named individuals.</p>
    <p><%= you_or_your_child.capitalize %> will not be identifiable in anything published. All personal data
