      trying to improve the service, as it allows them to review the most useful
      parts of the session after it has finished.

    <p>
      Taking part is entirely voluntary - it is up to you to decide whether or not <%= you_or_your_child %>

If you decide <%= you_or_your_child %> should take part <%= you_or_they %> do not have to answer questions <%= you_or_they %> do not want to answer. <%= you_or_they.capitalize %> can also change <%= @research_session.able_to_consent? ?

      at any time and withdraw without giving a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you agree <%= 'for your child/the child in your care' if @research_session.unable_to_consent? %> to take part, you will be given a copy of this information
      sheet and be asked to sign a consent form.
