  <h3 class="subtitle-small" id="private">Will what I say be kept confidential?</h3>
  <p>Yes. The goal of design research isnʼt to collect data, itʼs to find the
    insights we need to improve our services. We do not hand over the recordings; we
    edit and share insights relevant to the project. Whenever we share these
    insights, the material is fully anonymised and contributions cannot be
    attributed to named individuals.</p>
  <p>You will not be identifiable in anything published. All personal data
    collected as part of the research is stored securely and kept strictly
    confidential.</p>
