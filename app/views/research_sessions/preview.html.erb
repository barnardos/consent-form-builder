  <p class="highlight"><%= @research_session.focus %></p>

  <p>
    It is important that we test the current and future tools and services that
    we are developing with people like you so that we can make them as good as
    possible.
  </p>

  <h3 class="subtitle-small" id="who">Who is doing the research?</h3>
  <p>
    <%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_name) %> is the researcher who will be leading the session.

    <% if @research_session.researcher_other_name.present? %>
      <%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_name) %>ʼs colleague, <%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_other_name) %>,
        may join <%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_name) %> sometimes to help.

  <%= @research_session.methodology_list %>

  <p>
    With your permission we will record the session using
    <%= highlight(@research_session.recording_methods_list) %>. Recording the session helps the
    researcher and other research team members trying to improve the service, as
    it allows them to review the most useful parts of the session after it has
    finished.
  </p>

  <h3 class="subtitle-small" id="doi">Do I have to take part?</h3>
  <p>
    Taking part is entirely voluntary - it is up to you to decide whether or not
    to take part. If you decide to take part you do not have to answer questions
    you do not want to answer. You can also change your mind about taking part
    at any time and withdraw without giving a reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you agree to take part, you will be given a copy of this information
    sheet and be asked to sign a consent form.
  </p>

  <h3 class="subtitle-small" id="more">Where can I find out more?</h3>
  <p><%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_name) %> will be able to answer further questions about the
    research. <%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_name) %> can be contacted by email at
    <%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_email) %> or by telephone on <%= highlight(@research_session.researcher_phone) %>.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the way in which this research has ben conducted then please contact
    Joelle Bradly at <a href="mailto:joelle.bradly@barnardos.org.uk">joelle.bradly@barnardos.org.uk</a></p>

  <h3 class="subtitle-small" id="private">Will what I say be kept confidential?</h3>
  <p>Yes. The goal of design research isnʼt to collect data, itʼs to find the
    insights we need to improve our services. We do not hand over the recordings; we
    edit and share insights relevant to the project. Whenever we share these
    insights, the material is fully anonymised and contributions cannot be
    attributed to named individuals.</p>
  <p>You will not be identifiable in anything published. All personal data
    collected as part of the research is stored securely and kept strictly
    confidential.</p>
